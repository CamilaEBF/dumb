      <h1>PYRAMIDZ</h1>
      <h3>As ripped from Neopets</h3>
      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <p>Your objective is to clear the pyramid, which is made of a random subset of an ordinary 52-card playing deck.  Cards are represented by characters that designate their rank and suit (e.g. 2oH is 2 of Hearts).  Cards can be used by stacking the cards on a pile at (the top card is shown under "Current Card").  A card is allowed to be stacked if it is distance one (&#0177;1) away from the Current Card.  If there is no usable card, you may generate a new Current Card by clicking the "Draw" button.  The "Draw" button takes cards from the remainder of the deck that is not in the pyramid.</p>
      <p>Since I have made 0 efforts to ensure that the hidden cards are useful to you, this game is usually not winnable.  Enjoy.</p>
