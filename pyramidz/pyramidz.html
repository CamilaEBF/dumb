      <h1>PYRAMIDZ</h1>
      <h3>As ripped from Neopets</h3>
      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <p>Your objective is to clear the pyramid, which is made of a random subset of an ordinary 52-card playing deck, by stacking the cards on this pile at the top.  A card is allowed to be stacked if it is distance one away from the card currently displayed on the top of the pile.</p>
      <p>Since I have made 0 efforts to ensure that the hidden cards are useful to you, this game is usually not winnable.  Enjoy.</p>
